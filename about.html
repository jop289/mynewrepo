    <h2>The Beginning</h2>

    <p>It all began back home...I have always enjoyed drawing. Ever since I was young, I would bring around a pencil and notebook wherever I went. This is the beginning of my creative journey and how all my experiences have led me to <a href="#design">design</a>.</p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <h3>Education</h3>

    <p>Graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree</p>

    <p>Currently studying Graphic Design</p>

    <h3>Travel</h3>

    <p>Travelling is one of my favourite things to do. I have gained a lot of valuable experience from traveling. Seeing other perspectives and cultures has been so cool and I hope to go to more places around the world in the future.</p>

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>I love music. Music is one of my biggest inspirations. There are many genres that I like listening to. Music has a way of evoking emotion that fascinates me. I respect people who make music, from the building of an instrument, to the musician who plays the instrument, to the person who writes the music, the lyrics, and the singer that sings the songs.</p>

    <p>I usually listen to music a lot when I'm driving or going on a walk. I like to make playlists for certain moods and situations.</p>

    <h3>Film</h3>
    <p>I love watching movies and tv shows.</p>

    <h2>Searching</h2>
    <p>For a long time, I didn't know what I wanted to pursue a career in. I felt lost. There were so many opportunities but I didn't know how to choose! After working in a different career for a while, I have gained great experience and importantly, I have learned that I didn't want to continue working there. I realized that I wanted to do something more creative.</p>

    <h2><a name="design">Design</a></h2>
    <p>My design journey is very new and I have a lot I want to learn. I am currently attending school for Graphic Design. Going to school for a more creative career has been interesting. I am proud of myself for trying something new and out of my comfort zone but also nervous that I won't succeed but even more so, that I won't like it. However, I am taking it one step at a time. So far, I am enjoying this more than I have ever enjoyed school, which I take as a good sign. I am excited to see where this leads.</p>
